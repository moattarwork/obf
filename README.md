# *obf* - an obfuscation tool and library

*obf* is designed to obfuscate an input document, whilst ensuring that the output is still (somewhat) human-readable and 
while also maintaining consistency of mapping between an input plaintext and an obfuscated output, such that 
obf(plaintext) always yields the same result.

This latter characteristic means that *obf* is not really suitable for strong encryption, as frequency analysis of the 
output ciphertext, perhaps with the assistance of a crib, could make the output comprehensible to an attacker.

The intent of *obf* is to allow the sharing of potentially sensitive data outside of a protected zone while ensuring 
it's continued consistency, and thus operability without requiring any changes to other tools and tooling.

*obf* was developed as a tool to allow the copying of data (files and databases) from a protected "green" network to 
unprotected "red" zones, including developer workstations and laptops while maintaining reasonable data privacy. *obf* 
is intended to be used either as a standalone tool or as a library in an automated data-copy process.  

**Installation instructions**
-----------------------------
*obf* is written in Python, and you can use the pip installer to install it thus:

```
$ pip install obf
```

**Usage**
---------
```
obf [-h] [-b [blockedwords file]] [-w [codewords file]] [-c]
                      [-n [N]] [-e [E]] [-a [ALGO]] [-s [SALT]] [-l] [-v]
                      [plaintext]

```

#### positional arguments:

  ```plaintext             ```A plaintext to obfuscate. If no plaintext is provided,
                        then obf will look at stdin instead.

#### optional arguments:

```-h, --help```            show this help message and exit
  
```-b [blockedwords file]```
                        A file containing specific words to block. If missing
                        the entire input is obfuscated.
                        
```-w [codewords file]```   A file containing code words to use.
  
```-c ```                   Display a crib showing the mapping of blocked values
                        to their obfuscated values. Only works when a specific
                        blockfile is used with the -b option.
                        
```-n [N]```                An index to indicate which bytes of the generated hash
                        to use as a lookup into the codewords file. Defaults
                        to 0.
                        
```-e [E]```                A string of comma-separated domain name components
                        that should be exempt from obfuscation to aid
                        readability. Dots are not permitted/valid. Defaults to
                        'com,co,uk,org' and any that are specified on the
                        command line are added to this list.
                        
```-a [ALGO], --algo [ALGO]```
                        The hash algorithm to use as a basis for indexing the
                        codewords file; defaults to SHA256
                        
``` -s [SALT], --salt [SALT]```
                        A salt for the hash function to ensure uniqueness of
                        encoding.
                        
``` -l, --list-algos```      List available hash algorithms.

```-j [JSON], --json [JSON]```
                        Treat the input as JSON, and apply the obfuscation
                        rules to each of the fields/keys specified in this
                        space-delimited list

 
```-v ```                   Verbose mode = show key parameters, etc
